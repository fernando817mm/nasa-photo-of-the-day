1. Planning
    - Design a simple wire-frame
    - Break down the wire-frame into components
    A. Components
        - Which components will hold state?
        - What props will each component need (if any)?
        - Where will I fetch my data?
2. File Structure
    - Create a components folder
    - Create files for each component and place them in the proper folder created from the step above
